# ClawfootMod
A Stardew Valley mod in which you can change the farmers into lizardfolk, based off of RetroPixelLizard's Clawfoot character.

## Minium mod requirements:
* [Stardew Valley 1.3](https://stardewvalley.net/)
* [SMAPI 2.6-beta13](https://smapi.io/)
* [Content Patcher 1.4-beta.3](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)

## What the mod changes:
The male farmers get horns and clawed feet, going barefoot.
The female farmers are simply barefoot at the time.

To become closest like Clawfoot, pick the following settings:

### Skin:
* 18 -> A more brighter, lizardy green.

### Hair:
* 6 -> To have a mohawk like Clawfoot.
* 7 -> A slightly more stylized mohawk.

### Shirt:
* 24 -> To effectively be shirtless.

### Accessory:
* 20 -> To have a lizardface, rather than a duckface.

**Note:**
If you use SMAPI's Console Commands to change these, you will have use -1.
This is because SMAPI's count starts at 0, whereas the game starts at 1.
So 17 would be the lizard skin color, 23 the shirtless shirt.. and so on.

## Optional settings:
In config.json, you can change a few options.

### Add Shirt
(_Default: true_)
Replaces a boring green shirt with the 'shirtless' shirt.

### Add Skincolor
(_Default: true_)
Replaces the green skincolor with the greener lizard skincolor.

### Add Facemask
(_Default: true_)
Replaces the duckmask with the lizardmask.

### Add Hairstyles
(_Default: true_)
Replaces two kinda meh hairstyles with the mohawks.

### Fundoshi for Men?
(_Default: false_)
Will replace the men's bath towel with a fundoshi.
This was a request by RPL, specifically.

## Credits:
* Retro Pixel Lizard, aka RPL or Gyro Gun. He requested this mod, as well as later modifications.. Considering the default is based off of his character Clawfoot, I can hardly not credit him.
* PathosChild for helping out and for releasing Content Patcher, could not have finished this without him.
